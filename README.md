More details about the task and datasets can be found at our [project webpage](http://bonda.lti.cs.cmu.edu/teacher/). Please cite the above papers if you end up using our code and/or datasets. 

### Demo
Concept graph automatically induced from [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/):

### Usage
To conduct cross-validation using plain CGL, run
```
matlab -r main
```
Configurations of the program are located at `config.m`. To allow graph transduction, set
```
opt.transductive = false;
```
To carry out sparse CGL, set
```
opt.algorithm = @cgl_rank_sparse;
```
