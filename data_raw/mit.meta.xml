 <calendar> Introduction, Opening Discussion - How is power defined? Is it possible to use a single definition of power to describe a variety of social situations? - How do people get and use power? - How much power is lodged within personality and how much is part of the structure of the situation? - How does the use of power sometimes mystify the targets so that they do not recognize that power is being exerted? - Can power be equalized, or must some people always have more? - What is resistance? How might we identify resistance in situations of institutionalized power? # What is Power? Action and Intention # What Power is Not: Influence and Conformity # Force: The Limiting Case # Leadership and Charisma: Personal and Inspirational Power # Authority (1): The Ability to Command # Some Classical Views # Modern Debates # Authority (2): Power Redefined, Institutionalized, and Disciplined # Bureaucratic Organizations and Entrepreneurial Corporations # Modernity, Post-modern Colonialism, and The Global Community # The Possibilities of Resistance # Powersharing Can Power be Distributed Equally?</calendar>

 <calendar>Introduction Questions of the day: What is urban design? What is urban development? How are they connected and how do they affect our lives? # Ways of Seeing the City Questions of the day: What are the visible signs of change in cities? How can we measure the form of cities? How do the underlying values of the observer influence what is observed? # The Forces That Made Boston Questions of the day: What does the history of Boston's development tell us about the issues facing the city today? Are these forces common to all cities? # Walking Tour of Boston Meet at the Government Center T-Stop (outside in front of the City Hall) at 8:00 am. For those students who can't join the tour until 10:30 - we will be in the Skywalk of the Prudential Center Tower (800 Boylston Street between Exeter and Gloucester Streets) at approximately 10:30 am. We will end the tour at noon at South Station Quincy Market where you can have lunch and/or catch a train back to MIT. # The Design of American Cities Questions of the day: What can you tell about a city's origins from its founders? What is the difference between agrarian settlements and industrial cities? What happened to cities as America industrialized? # The Industrial City and Its Critics Questions of the day: What were nineteenth century and early twentieth century housing and workplace reformers trying to reform? Do we still have company towns? # Development Controls Part I: The Institutionalization of Planning and Zoning Questions of the day: Can we design cities without designing buildings? How can zoning and other design controls improve our public space? # Development Controls Part II: Beyond Zoning: Urban Design Guidelines, Design Review and Development Incentives Questions of the day: What is the relationship between development incentives and quality public space? Can urban design guidelines and design review ensure good urban design? What are the newest development controls used by planners? # Three Urban Utopias: - Ebenezer Howard's Garden City - Le Corbusier's Radiant City - Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City Questions of the day: What assumptions does each thinker make about how people should live in cities? What beliefs does each hold about the relationship between city design and social change? What aspects of these "utopias" have actually come to pass? # New Towns in the United States and Abroad Question of the day: What motivates planners to design new towns? # The Suburbs Part I: The Origins and Growth of Suburbs Questions of the day: Why do we have suburbs? How and why do the designs of new suburbs differ from the designs of older ones? # The Suburbs Part II: Rethinking American Suburbs Questions of the day: How do "urbanism" and "suburbanism" differ as "ways of life"? What is the appeal of small town life, and can this be designed? # Shaping Private Development/Growth Management Questions of the day: What are the social consequences of sprawl? Can private development be controlled to manage growth on the regional scale? What are the current techniques used to manage growth? Guest speaker: Westwood, MA town officials and Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes representative - developers for new TOD in former industrial park along the Westwood commuter rail line. # Midterm Exam # Urban Renewal and Its Critics Questions of the day: When does a "neighborhood" become a "slum"? How does one achieve a balance between "renewal" and "preservation"? # The Tumult of American Public Housing Question of the day: What does urban design have to do with the problems of American public housing? Guest speaker: Professor Lawrence J. Vale # Cultural Districts, Heritage Areas and Tourism: If You Name It, Will They Come? Question of the day: How can urban designers, developers and planners create new economic value for historic places and the inner city? # Discussion of Exercise 2 # Downtown Development and the Privatization of Public Space Question of the day: Is 'Public Space' being 'Privatized'? # Landscape, the Environment and the City Questions of the day: How has concern for the landscape, open space, environment and quality of life shaped cities? Can cities be truly "green"? Guest speaker: Thomas Oles # Natural Processes Guest speaker: Thomas Oles # Transportation and Its Impacts Question of the day: How has public transportation policy shaped urban form? # The Rise of Community Activism Questions of the day: How has community participation changed urban design and development? Can urban development be a force for social equity? Guest speaker: Lizbeth Heyer, Associate Director of Community Development, Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation. # The Virtual City Question of the day: How have advances in telecommunications technology changed the way we use and conceive cities? Guest speaker: Dennis Frenchman # The Secure City - The Fortification of Space Question of the day: How are concerns about safety and security shaping public space and redefining communities? # Discussion of Final Paper # Final Exam</calendar>

 <calendar> Introduction Overview, textbooks, history of crystallography # Symmetry in 2D Definition of symmetry, introduction of symmetry operators Compatibility of symmetry operators with translation Combining symmetry operations and determination of plane groups # Symmetry in 3D Extension of the plane groups concept to the third dimension: space groups Introduction of screw axes and glide planes Point groups vs. space groups The unit cell and crystallographic conventions # X-rays and matter X-ray generation Diffraction experiment with optical grids and laser pointers Convolution theorem and Fourier transformation Introduction of Bragg's law and Miller indices # Geometry of diffraction Reciprocal space vs. real space Ewald construction as a geometric interpretation of Bragg's law # Structure factors Real atoms are no point atoms (atomic form factors) and show thermal motion (atomic displacement factors) Having more than one atom per unit cell leads to structure factors Fourier transformation gives rise to electron density; crystallographic resolution # Structure factors II Complex numbers, Euler's equation and the argand plane Introduction of the phase problem # Symmetry in reciprocal space Introduction of Friedel's law and laue groups Space group determination: |E2-1| statistics, systematic absences, crystallographic directions for triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic and tetragonal systems Introduction of the Patterson function and Harker sections, as well as direct methods for structure solution # Structure refinement Different types of electron density maps (Fo, Fc, Fo-Fc, etc.) Introduction of anisotropic displacement parameters Minimization functions: the least-squares approach and different R-factors Crystallographic parameters, constraints and restraints # Structure refinement II Problems and pitfalls: wrong space group, atom type assignment (all electrons are blue), disorder, twinning What are artifacts (libration, C-C triple bonds, Fourier truncation ripples, etc.)? Finding the hydrogen atoms, "riding model" # Anomalous scattering Absorption of X-ray photons leads to loss of symmetry in orbital geometry, which results in a violation of Fridel's law # Practical aspects and related methods Growing crystals and keeping them alive (never remove the mother liquor!) Mounting crystals onto the diffractometer Short introduction of powder diffraction, neutron diffraction and EXAFS Crystallographic data bases (ICSD, CSD, PDB, reciprocal net) # Quick recap Symmetry, Bragg's law, Miller indices, real space vs. reciprocal space, Ewald construction, structure factors, electron density, symmetry in reciprocal space, laue groups vs. point groups vs. space groups, space group determination, Patterson function, structure refinement, parameters/constraints/restraints, anisotropic displacement parameters, libration, hydrogen atoms # Exam You have 50 minutes to answer all questions. You can use pens, a calculator, ruler and compass, as well as a letter sized piece of paper with anything written on it. No books or other material is allowed.</calendar>

 <calendar> Introduction: Defining the educational problem These readings examine three major dimensions of the economy's performance. One is the growth of productivity, the determinant of rising living standards. The second is income inequality. The third is income mobility—the extent to which someone born in one part of the income distribution moves to another part of the distribution (higher or lower) over their lifetime. As we will see, all three of these dimensions rely to some degree on education. # Human capital theory: The basic economic perspective on education This reading summarizes the basic approach of economists to education in which education is viewed as an investment made by the individual (you deciding to go to college), society (provision of public K-12 schools) or both (you deciding to go to a state university). From an individual's perspective, evaluating the investment is similar to evaluating whether one should invest in an office building or a new printer for an office. # Early childhood education: How important? Society or the individual can invest in education at different points in the individual's life: Early childhood, grades K-6, on-the-job training and so on. Investments at different points in the life cycle may give very different rates of return. These pieces examine the proposition that much of cognitive functioning is well established by the time the child is age four or five with the implication that the rate of return to educational investments in grades K-12 is much lower—i.e. it is not where we should be putting our greatest efforts. Read the Feinstein article for general content and its main conclusions and do not spend a lot of time on those statistical parts that you don't understand. # When did earnings become so dependent on education? If we want to explain market changes over time, a central question is whether the supply side or the demand side of the market is doing most of the changing. Imagine you are examining the behavior of the market for middle-aged men whose education stopped with a bachelors' degree. Do you expect the supply side of this market to change more quickly than the demand side or vice-versa? # Do our regression estimates overestimate the impact of education on earnings? The case of ability bias. Think about a regression model that estimates the impact of an additional year of schooling on earnings. We know that on average, students who graduate high school have higher grades, test scores, etc. than students who drop out. Similarly, students who go to college typically have higher grades, test scores, etc. than students whose education stops with a high school diploma. Question: Why might this "sorting" cause us to question our regression estimate of the effect on earnings of an additional year of education? # If the return to education is real, does it reflect skills learned or is it a signal? If the estimated return to education is accurate, why does it exist? Does, say, the earnings value of a college diploma reflect what is learned in the college? Or, alternatively, do the employers see the diploma as a signal that the student was smart enough to get into college in the first place? Before reading the articles, ask yourself what data you might use to distinguish between these two possibilities. # Why has the rate of return to education increased? We now know from wage data that labor market demand has shifted heavily toward more educated labor. To what extent do these shifts reflect changes in technology? In international trade? In institutional factors like unions and CEO perceptions of "appropriate behavior"? # What skills are now rewarded in the workplace? If the combination of computerization and offshoring is reducing the number of jobs requiring "rules-based" thinking, how do we describe the thinking required for the jobs that are left - particularly those jobs that pay good wages? # Midterm # Do smaller classes raise achievement? Reducing class size is one of the most discussed ways to raise student achievement. Because the reform is simple to explain, it is a good starting point to discuss questions we will face for the rest of the course: Exactly how is this reform supposed to raise student achievement? What kind of evidence do we need to know whether this reform works? Can we get the evidence from "natural experiments" that occur out in the world? Alternatively, do we need to conduct controlled experiments that we evaluate? If so, how should the experiment/evaluation be structured? # School vouchers and parental choice A second frequently discussed educational reform is educational choice including school vouchers. With a few exceptions (which we will discuss in class), natural experiments involving school choice are hard to come by. The question, then, is how we should set up and evaluate demonstration experiments. The issue becomes more complex because many parties to this debate have strong pro or anti-choice views and structure their analyses to support their opinions. One of our jobs is to factor out that bias. There are only two papers for this topic because the second paper is quite detailed. You should be able to understand all the results even if you do not understand all the statistical methodology. # School accountability, standards and testing A third widely used educational reform is a set of educational standards and assessments - think "No Child Left Behind". Unlike traditional standardized tests - for example, the California Achievement Tests or Iowa tests that many of you took in elementary school - the scores of these assessments are widely publicized to the public and their design (which varies from state to state) raises a number of questions: What subjects should be tested? How should the tests be designed (Multiple Choice? Partial credit for how you set up a problem? etc.)? Should good test scores lead to a reward for the school? For the individual teacher? Should bad test scores lead to penalties? # Teacher quality and teacher training Policy makers discuss the need do improve teacher quality but unlike smaller class size or standards, it is not very clear how to do it. There are at least four questions we need to answer. What has actually happened to teacher quality over time? What characteristics should we look for when we hire teachers? What characteristics should we look for in deciding whether to give a teacher tenure? And are there things we can do to improve the classroom skills of teachers who are already on the job? # Can technology complement what teachers do? Everyone agrees that well-educated students must know how to get information from the Web, etc. There is less agreement on whether computer technology can complement teachers in their instructional role. We can think of two broad application areas: Computer tutors that help students work on basic reading, writing and mathematics, and simulations that require students to solve complex "real world" problems in the classroom. Most of our focus in this section will be on drills including a case study of computer-graded essays - how the software was developed and what it can do. # Higher education: Basic issues and structure For most policy makers, one U.S. educational goal is a greater number of college graduates. Here as in earlier topics, we need to clarify why the current number of college graduates is limited. Is it that too few kids are applying? Is it that an adequate number are applying but too many drop out? At the same time, before we can think about policy, we need to understand what colleges are trying to do just as we need to understand what firms are trying to do before we can consider the impact of tax policy. # Higher education policy Turning to policy, expanded financial aid, remedial instruction and services to encourage students to continue in college are three of the most discussed tools for increasing the number of college graduates. The question is how well each of these tools work? # Wrap up</calendar>

 <calendar>Introduction: What is New in the "New" Global Economy # The Globalization Perspective Which jobs are going where, and to whom, depends on the technological factors that affect the international division/distribution of labor. According to this perspective there are many contenders for different segments of work/production. # The National Perspective Country specific cultural, institutional factors affect the type of companies that prevail in a given country, their strategies, and organization. # How does Globalization Affect "National Champions" and Artisanal Producers? Examples from the Car and the Wine Industry What happens when companies from different cultures merge? Can one still talk about national models when confronted with massive delocalization of industries? Guest Speaker: Pat Gercik, MIT-Japan Managing Director and MISTI Associate-Director # Studying and Working Across Cultures: Student Presentations of Their Experiences Abroad Presentations should be 5-8 minutes long; in describing your experience abroad, please include the most surprising similarities and dissimilarities you encountered, and relate them to broader cultural-institutional features of the country you visited. # The Technological Perspective The specific technological content that underlays various industries dictates what goes and what stays. Ie: mature industries move to, or prosper in, less advanced countries, innovative ones stay. Is this still- the case? The case of India Guest Speaker: Prof. Ken Keniston, MIT, Andrew Mellon Professor of Human Development, Science, Technology and Society program and MIT-India Program Director. # Which Companies succeed and Which Ones Fail? Is there a Recipe for Success? Guest Speaker: Prof. Suzanne Berger, MIT Professor of Political Science. # How to Keep Competitive Innovations and Entrepreneurship Where Do Innovations Come From? Is there one best place or way to be an entrepreneur? Guest Speaker: Tim Rowe, CEO, Cambridge Innovation Center and Venture Partner, Draper Fisher, Jurvetson, New England Fun. # The Importance of Human Capital and the Pursuit of Excellence Guest Speaker: Bob Buderi, Former Chief Editor of Technology Review, and current MIT-CIS Fellow on "Doing Research in China: Microsoft Bejing Lab" # Governing Globalization What is the Relationship between Governance and economic growth? Can Globalization be Governed and Benchmarks be Established? And if So, How and by Whom? # Corporate Citizenship in the Global Economy What are global Corporations Responsible For and To Whom? Are there different models of Corporate citizenship? And How realistic are they? Discussion based on the Nike, Walmart and Costco cases. # Conclusion Student presentations and discussion of their research papers and concluding remarks.</calendar>

 <calendar>Introduction # What is the difference between laws and commands? # How do we determine the content of laws? Do laws have moral content? # How should judges interpret the law? # Is there an obligation to obey the law? Skepticism about political obligation… # Optimism about political obligation… # Should we sometimes disobey the law? # When exactly does an act cause harm? # Where does the burden of proof lie? # What counts as evidence of guilt / liability? # Is it appropriate to punish acts that "successfully" cause harm (e.g., murder, vehicular manslaughter) more severely than similar acts which, merely as a matter of good luck, do not? # What, if anything, justifies punishment of offenders by the state? # When is the state justified in interfering in the lives of its citizens? # What are the justifications for and limits of freedom of speech? # Can we harm people by bringing them into existence, and should we be liable for that harm? # What special ethical problems do lawyers face?

 <calendar>Overview of syllabus. "Creole" people and "Creole" languages in space and in time. General and language-/linguistic-specific background. Introduction of basic terminology and fundamental - and often erroneous - assumptions in Creole linguistics. (The linguistic study of Creole languages is also known as "CREOLISTICS".) The set of assumptions that we will critically examine throughout this class includes the foundational axiom of Creolistics, namely the so-called "PIDGIN-TO-CREOLE LIFE-CYCLE." [According to the PIDGIN-TO-CREOLE LIFE-CYCLE, any Creole language would have emerged abruptly as the antecedent PIDGIN acquired native speakers. One correlate of that axiom is that Creole languages fall outside the class of structurally "normal" / "genetic" languages with "normal" / "genetic" pedigree as defined by the family-tree model of gradual linguistic change / speciation: languages in the standard family-tree (e.g., French) are assumed to have developed gradually from "normal" full-fledged languages (e.g., Latin), not from structurally reduced Pidgins.] # What is the subject matter? Recapitulate from last time: What does it mean to study Creole Languages and Caribbean Identities? How does it all happen? The socio-historical and cultural context of Creolization. The dynamics of language contact. What can Creole linguistics and attitudes about Creoles teach us about Caribbean identities? What can Creole linguistics and attitudes about Creoles teach us about identity formation outside the Caribbean? And what can Creolistics teach us about (the identities of) linguists and other scholars who write about Creole languages? Creolistics as a case study of the interface between power and (the production of) knowledge. Implications for, or parallels with, other kinds (e.g. cultural) 'creolization'. Linguistic creolization and/vs. cultural creolization. # The 'anglophone' Caribbean. Introduction. Socio-historical overview. What does 'West-Indian Creole' sound like? What does it look like? A sampling. Are all Creoles equal? The so-called Creole Continuum. Linguistic sketches. Morphology and syntax of West-Indian (English-lexicon based) Creoles. Gaining familiarity with Jamaican Creole aka Patwa - analyzing a Patwa text, Big Tings Laas Wiik. Can we identify 'Creole features'? How? Meta-linguistic attitudes. Issues of (mis - ?) identification. The politics of Patwa. The socio-linguistics of stigmatized language varieties - in the Caribbean and beginnings. Why are certain stigmas (which?) associated with Creole languages? By whom? Prescriptivism vs. descriptivism revisited. # The case of Haiti. Locating Haiti in space and in time. A socio-historical and cultural sketch. A (socio-) linguistic sketch. Diglossia? Meta-linguistic attitudes vis-à-vis Haitian Creole. Morphology and syntax of Haitian Creole. # More on Haitian Creole morpho-syntax. Creole Genesis: The Haitian case. What's to be explained? Earlier theories and their assumptions about the contributions of Europeans and Africans in Creole genesis. Prejudices, fallacies and facts. Problems for traditional approaches to language classification and to the classification of diachronic phenomena ( e.g., "language change" vs. "Creole genesis"; cf. the deeply-rooted dualism that opposes Creole vs. non-Creole languages from the 17th-century onwards). An overview of 'modern' attempts to explain linguistic creolization. Three major theories: Substratist (pro-Africanist), Superstratist (pro-Europeanist) and Universalist (pro-'creationist'). A debate. Creole-genesis theories and their (implicit) claims on the origins of Creole culture and on the formation of Caribbean identities. Does Creole genesis really require a 'separate' (i.e., sui generis) theory? "Cartesian-Uniformitarian" approaches. # Did all Creoles develop in the same "catastrophic" way? Did Creoles develop in radically different ways from how non-Creoles have evolved? Can Creole morphology be used to typologically set apart from non-Creole morphology on the basis of purely-synchronic and purely-structural criteria? What role do language acquisition (first and second) and language use and processing play in Creole genesis and in language change more generally? Interaction between internal/cognitive and external/sociohistorical factors in the creation and transmission of linguistic structure. Creole-genesis theories and meta-linguistic attitudes. The role of (post -) colonial history and of culture in the formation of Creole languages and Creole studies. Relationship between power and the production of knowledge - in Creole studies and beyond. # Are there any "Creole" (- like) languages in the U.S.? A socio-linguistic look at African-American English (AAE) and at Gullah. On the genesis (or geneses) of AAE and of Gullah? AAE, Gullah and 'de-creolization' - myth or reality? AAE: Creole origins + de-Creolization? The socio-linguistics and politics of AAE. The Ebonics debate. Validation AAE. Learning from Oprah and others. A comparative look at West-Indian Creoles, Gullah and AAE. # Patwa in West-Indian literature: siiryos bizniz! 'Creole literature': an oxymoron? Literature and/vs. 'Orature'. What language(s) should West-Indian poets express themselves in? Language and identity in Caribbean literature. Louise Bennett, Mutabaruka, Michael Smith, Derek Walcott, Lorna Goodison, etc. # La ultima Cena 'The Last Supper' (film). An apercu from 19th-century Cuba. The socio-historical context of Creolization (revisited). Slavery within European civilization. Christianity and slavery. The docile slave as good Christian. Christianity and slavery. Irreconcilable conflicts. Linguistic and cultural continua. Maroon phenomena. Sex and gender in the formation of Caribbean identities. Re/production and resistance. # Discuss proposals for term papers. Representing Creoleness. Perspectives from history, from orthography, from literature and from sociology. What is to be represented, and how? The Haitian Creole orthographic debates. How do Creole speakers chose to project themselves to the world? Past, present and future of (representing) Creoleness. Apparent paradoxes. Creole speakers' attitudes toward elements of their Creole language and culture. Caribbean literature (revisited). "How to be a Caribbean writer?" More on Creole Identities. Haiti vs. the Dominican Republic.Mirrors of the Heart (film). # Religion in the Caribbean. Vodou in Haiti. The Divine Horsemen (film). Yoruba religion in cuba. Oggun: Eternally Present (film). Caribbean religions: 'New world' syncretisms and/or links to a mythical Africa? Other cultural aspects of Creolization. Dance, music etc. Creole genesis (revisited). To conclude: what does it all mean? Epilogue: where do we go from here? # Students presentations of their final projects.</calendar>

 <calendar>Introduction # Immerse yourself in the assigned Minuets and Trios of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Listen to the recordings, read the scores Prepare for an identification quiz next week. I will play several excerpts, you will identify each excerpt by (a) its composer, (b) its opus number (Köchel number for Mozart) or key, and (c) whether it is from the Minuet or the Trio # Complete the melody and harmonic sketch in Minuet exercise 1 Complete a Roman numeral analysis of Mozart's Minuet from K. 458 Bring the scores for K. 458 and K. 499 to class The Minuet and Trio identification quiz will be given in class # Complete Minuet exercise 2 Analyze the form and the harmony in Mozart's Minuet and Trio in D, K. 499 # Revise Minuet exercise 2 (C Major) according to our discussion in the prior class. Revise and complete your Roman numeral harmonic sketch. Imagine that the melody line is a first violin part: write the cello part. Note: The work that you hand in should be a fair copy: copy it into a fresh printout of the exercise Analyze Haydn Op. 71/2 for class discussion # Begin writing your own Minuet in classical style. Compose an 8 measure (or so) exposition to the first repeat. Limit yourself, for now, to 2 parts: the first violin and the cello. Bring your original manuscript to class plus 2 copies # Revise your Minuet beginning as necessary; forge ahead to the beginning of the reprise. Continue to limit yourself to first violin and cello for now Analyze the Minuet and Trio from Beethoven, Op. 18/5 for class discussion Bring Minuet Models 1 and 2 to class again for one last time # Revise your Minuets according to our discussion in the prior class. Complete the two-part version. Begin orchestrating for string quartet To assist in your orchestration: I have provided several Minuet model compositions, including the 2-part models that we have been discussing in class, and a completed orchestration of each model. Please study these carefully before you begin your own orchestrations. Print out the models and bring to class We will begin class with an analytical discussion of Beethoven, Op. 18/5 # Continue work on your Minuets at a steady pace from now on Prepare Mozart K. 421 for discussion in class # Complete your Minuet, fully orchestrated for string quartet We shall complete our discussion of K. 421 # Complete your Trio in outer parts (violin 1 and cello) Prepare Haydn, op. 71, no. 1 for discussion in class # Begin to familiarize yourself with the Lieder of Schubert and Schumann. Always listen at least twice: once with just the text and translation, once with the score In class we shall focus upon two songs of Schubert: An Sylvia, and Gretchen am Spinnrade. Compare the english and the German versions of An Sylvia # Readings of your Minuets by [an anonymous professional string quartet] in Killian Hall. Bring at least 3 copies of the score (1 is for me), and a good, clean set of parts # Analyze the key relationships in Gretchen am Spinnrade. What is the harmony at the climax ("Und ach! sein Kuß!")? How does Schubert arrive at this chord? Familiarize yourself with Schubert, Die schöne Müllerin, nos. 7-10. Remember always to compare the text with the music. How well does strophic form capture the expressive qualities of the poetry? What makes the music expressive, in spite of the repetition? # Familiarize yourself with songs 7, 8, and 10 in Die Schöne Müllerin. Analyze the harmony, phrase structure, relationship between the text and the music. In 'Ungeduld,' how does Schubert convey an impression of impatience? In 'Moregengruss,' what is the function of the chromatic harmonies in mm. 12-15? In 'Thränenregen,' how do you explain Schubert's different treatment of the last stanza? Begin identifying potential texts for your song composition. You will need to bring 2 choices to the next class. You may choose from the sample romantic poems provided, or simply use these as models for your own choices # Study Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" and Schumann's "Waldesgespräch" as examples of through-composed song form Bring to class your 2 selected texts for your song composition; we will read these in class # Begin work on your song. Sketch parts of your vocal line and ideas for a piano accompaniment. Write a piano introduction In addition, familiarize yourself with Schumann's Dichterliebe, Nos. 1-7. You'll find that the songs are full of enigma: What key is the first song in? Where do phrases end in song 2 (Aus meinen Tra en sprießen)? Where is the climax in song 4 (Wenn ich in deine Augen seh')? What is the opening chord in song 5 (Ich will meine Seele tauchen), and what is its effect? What modifications does Schumann make to Heine's poem in Song 7 (Ich grolle nicht) and what effect does this have on the musical form? # By the end of the week, a final draft of your song should be emailed to Janna Baty and Daniel Curtis. Remember to include the poem in your attachment, and to write your name and the title of the composition at the head of every page. (Also include a polite message to the musicians in the body of your email) # Song readings with Janna Baty and Daniel Curtis, at Killian Hall. Bring three hard copies of your work to the reading: one for you, one for me, and a backup # Familiarize yourself with the 2 Wolf songs in your collection. How useful is roman numeral analysis for understanding this music? You will also have an opportunity to do your course evaluation today, and to discuss Monday's song readings, future courses, and other topics that might be on your mind</calendar>

Investigation of what light contributes to a theater piece. Discussion of principles and functions of lighting design; how period, genre and style affect it; the choices made in developing a plot and cue synopsis. Assignments: script analysis from the lighting point of view; compilation of an image library chosen for specific lighting qualities; creation and execution of a mini lighting design to the musical selection of the student's choice. # What is Costume? Study of silhouette, color and texture combined with careful script analysis will lead to renderings for two or three projects. The complete production process is discussed with attention to research, swatching, purchasing and drawing in support of design. # What is Scenery? Exploration of mass, color, spatial organization and visual imagery in response to the requirements of three scenes or "psychic spaces." Color rendering techniques are introduced and renderings are produced in several different media, including uncolored models. # Final project design proposal statements and preliminary plans for the final project will be discussed: Entire Staff Presentation of mid-term projects. # Lighting 2 Rendering and Tools of Design: color, cues, areas, specials, washes. # Costume 2 # Scenery 2 # Lighting 3 Lighting Project - design lights to a piece of music you choose. # Costume 3 # Scenery 3 # Technical Direction and the Design Process An examination of how construction is affected by the director's concept and design decisions. # Collaboration/Concept Group Constructing a production concept in collaboration via brainstorming; finding a personal "take" on a script. # Project Presentation</calendar>

 <calendar>Introduction and overview # Dance How is dance "central" to hip hop culture? How is it marginalized? What kinds of dances do hedz do? How have hip hop dances changed over time? Where are the sources of dance in hip hop? A consideration of capoiera and early African American dance forms. # Graffiti, fashion, and visual culture How have fashion and graffiti been important to hip hop style? How did graffiti grow up? How did baggy pants and dookie chains become popular? Has flossing always been a part of hip hop? Are there boundaries to gender representations in hip hop fashion or visual culture? Case study: Diddy # Sex and sexuality Is hip hop obsessed with depictions of sex and sexuality? What kinds of depictions are most prevalent? What depictions are resisted by hedz, and why? How do sex and sexuality feed hip hop into world markets? # Anarchy and activism Hip Hop has long been figured as the "CNN of the Streets," able to incite action and progressive change. But gangsta strains of hip hop seem to incite anarchy as much as activism. Are activism and anarchy two sides of the same coin? Can they be successfully combined in popular music for progressive social action? Case study: Public Enemy # Misogyny and feminism Why does misogyny occupy such a large part of the hip hop imaginary? How might sexual role-playing be healthy or hurtful to young people in various contexts? Is misogyny inevitable in the construction of popular culture? Is misogyny inseparable from hip hop? Alternately, how can hip hop be enabled to empower women? What kinds of hip hop combats misogyny, and how is it produced? What sorts of rhymes and beats support feminist concerns? # Realness What is the "real" in hip hop? How is it recognized? How does authenticity play into hip hop sensibilities? What are the boundaries of the real in hip hop? How have those boundaries changed? Case study: Kayne West # Globalization How is the global reach of hip hop related to commodities and exchange? How has hip hop changed as it has attracted a global audience and inspired a global marketplace? # DJ'ing and musicality If hip hop music is mostly mediated, how does live performance figure into its aesthetic imperatives? What sorts of "liveness" are valued in hip hop music? How is musicality measured by djs? What are the relationships between composing and turntablism? # Mediation and science fiction What are the implications of mediated artifacts on the musical world of hip hop? What genres of electronic music does hip hop embrace? How does science fiction figure into the hip hop "real?" What effects do technology inspire in hip hop? A consideration of Afro-futurism. # Whiteness Within an American context, what are some of the ways that white youth respond to hip hop? How is "whiteness" embedded in the construction of hip hop? What are the particularly American wages of racial segregation in terms of popular culture, and especially hip hop? # Underground How does the underground function as a continual site within hip hop? How has its location changed over time? What can an underground do that a mainstream cannot? # Review Compile annotated bibliographic snapshot; suggestions for [academic] interventions</calendar>

 <calendar> Introduction, Opening Discussion - How is power defined? Is it possible to use a single definition of power to describe a variety of social situations? - How do people get and use power? - How much power is lodged within personality and how much is part of the structure of the situation? - How does the use of power sometimes mystify the targets so that they do not recognize that power is being exerted? - Can power be equalized, or must some people always have more? - What is resistance? How might we identify resistance in situations of institutionalized power? # What is Power? Action and Intention # What Power is Not: Influence and Conformity # Force: The Limiting Case # Leadership and Charisma: Personal and Inspirational Power # Authority (1): The Ability to Command # Some Classical Views # Modern Debates # Authority (2): Power Redefined, Institutionalized, and Disciplined # Bureaucratic Organizations and Entrepreneurial Corporations # Modernity, Post-modern Colonialism, and The Global Community # The Possibilities of Resistance # Powersharing Can Power be Distributed Equally?</calendar>

 <calendar>Introduction: What is New in the "New" Global Economy # The Globalization Perspective Which jobs are going where, and to whom, depends on the technological factors that affect the international division/distribution of labor. According to this perspective there are many contenders for different segments of work/production. # The National Perspective Country specific cultural, institutional factors affect the type of companies that prevail in a given country, their strategies, and organization. # How does Globalization Affect "National Champions" and Artisanal Producers? Examples from the Car and the Wine Industry What happens when companies from different cultures merge? Can one still talk about national models when confronted with massive delocalization of industries? Guest Speaker: Pat Gercik, MIT-Japan Managing Director and MISTI Associate-Director # Studying and Working Across Cultures: Student Presentations of Their Experiences Abroad Presentations should be 5-8 minutes long; in describing your experience abroad, please include the most surprising similarities and dissimilarities you encountered, and relate them to broader cultural-institutional features of the country you visited. # The Technological Perspective The specific technological content that underlays various industries dictates what goes and what stays. Ie: mature industries move to, or prosper in, less advanced countries, innovative ones stay. Is this still- the case? The case of India Guest Speaker: Prof. Ken Keniston, MIT, Andrew Mellon Professor of Human Development, Science, Technology and Society program and MIT-India Program Director. # Which Companies succeed and Which Ones Fail? Is there a Recipe for Success? Guest Speaker: Prof. Suzanne Berger, MIT Professor of Political Science. # How to Keep Competitive Innovations and Entrepreneurship Where Do Innovations Come From? Is there one best place or way to be an entrepreneur? Guest Speaker: Tim Rowe, CEO, Cambridge Innovation Center and Venture Partner, Draper Fisher, Jurvetson, New England Fun. # The Importance of Human Capital and the Pursuit of Excellence Guest Speaker: Bob Buderi, Former Chief Editor of Technology Review, and current MIT-CIS Fellow on "Doing Research in China: Microsoft Bejing Lab" # Governing Globalization What is the Relationship between Governance and economic growth? Can Globalization be Governed and Benchmarks be Established? And if So, How and by Whom? # Corporate Citizenship in the Global Economy What are global Corporations Responsible For and To Whom? Are there different models of Corporate citizenship? And How realistic are they? Discussion based on the Nike, Walmart and Costco cases. # Conclusion Student presentations and discussion of their research papers and concluding remarks.</calendar>

What is this thing we call "public policy" and why does it exist? Is there more to the "public interest" than the aggregation of self-interests or finding solutions to common problems? What is a public problem? What did we experience in the Fish Banks simulation? What could have been done to improve the outcome? # Designing Government? Governments come in infinite varieties. If we could design a government from scratch, what characteristics would we like to see? How should it be organized? What "institutions" would we want to create? The American Model of governance serves as the foundation for this discussion and the rest of the course. We look at the design, distribution of authority, and relationships among legislatures, executive agencies, and the courts in the context of American federalism. # Models of Public Policy Decision Making In thinking about formulating public policy, we begin by approaching the task as an exercise in technical problem solving. What is the problem? What are the most promising solutions? We then expand our thinking to include other -- sometimes powerful -- considerations that influence the choice of solutions. # National Security Policy - Foreign Threats Providing security from external threats is the historical role of government. We examine "who" makes national security policy. # National Security Policy - Domestic Threats Does the "technical approach" really capture all the important elements of good public policy? We examine the basic concepts of security and liberty exploring how they are used to argue, validate, and legitimize policy claims. We introduce the idea of policy tradeoffs. # Trade and Development Policy We move on to the basic concepts of equity, fairness, and efficiency exploring how they are used to argue, validate, and legitimize policy claims. # Trade and Development Policy (cont.) # Environmental Policy: Pollution and Environmental Justice When civil rights and environmental protection clash. # Environmental Policy: Pollution and Environmental Justice (cont.) # Environmental Policy: Endangered Species The history of the endangered species act is a history of collisions among public interests and between public interests and private interests. How did this law come to be? What does it tell us about government intent and law making? # Environmental Policy: Endangered Species (cont.) # Energy Policy Government can provide information (mileage, safety). # Health Policy # Health Policy (cont.) # Health Policy (cont.) # Social Policy # Social Policy: Allocating Rights Government can create rights. Civil rights, property rights, privacy rights are conveyed by the government to its citizens. These rights shape and constrain policy and may be tested as times change. # Social Policy (cont.) # Crime Policy: A Cost-Benefit Analysis Using public resources for the greatest public benefit. # Public Health and Risk Assessment How safe is too safe? What Price Safety? # Evaluating Educational Policy Can market competition improve education? What works?</calendar>

 <calendar>Introduction to Environmental Politics and Policy # A Brief 300 Year History of American Environmentalism (PDF) This introduction to the course reviews the evolution of environmentalism in the U.S. since the colonial era. # The Environmental Impact of Human Activity: Is there a Problem? (PDF) We begin with a very basic question: How severe are the environmental problems we are facing? Is the earth facing a looming environmental catastrophe? These authors believe we are approaching a planetary crisis. # The Institutional Setting of U.S. Environmental Policy (PDF) Who are the key players in environmental policymaking? How does the environmental policymaking process work? # Legislating Clean Air (PDF 1) (PDF 2) The government had to do something about America's unbreathable air. And it did: the Clean Air Act of 1970. Congress set air standards, set deadlines, and ordered the air to be cleansed. This class examines the driving forces behind the rise of environmental legislation that poured out of the Congress beginning in 1970s. The legislative surge in American environmentalism--the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act in particular--ushered in an era of "command and control" regulation setting the stage for political conflict between private enterprise and the public interest. # Commanding Clean Water (PDF) The Clean Water Act of 1972 was supposed to make all the waters of the U.S. clean by 1985. What happened and why? Congress, concerned that government environmental agencies might become "captive" of the very industries they were supposed to monitor and regulate, put citizen enforcement provisions in the Clean Water Act. Quickly, environmental litigators and the courts became major players in environmental policy. #   # The Slippery Slope of Environmental Protection: The Case of Wetlands (PDF) This class explores how the reach of a law can expand beyond what its original creators intended. We look at how a series of court cases broadened the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act and forced the US Army Corps of Engineers to protect wetlands--and then two decades later forced it to "unprotect" them. # Endangered Species and Biodiversity (PDF) Americans have always had a schizophrenic "environmental" attitude toward wildlife and the landscape. An unstable mix of values:--romanticism, utilitarianism, dominionism (fear), and liberty (common property ownership)--has made preservation and protection of America's natural landscape a policy rife with internal contradictions, reversals, and too-little too-late reactions. The Endangered Species Act (1973) suggests that American policy-makers were prepared to make tough decisions favoring biodiversity over the economy. Was this true? And if so, how do we explain it? We also explore the role of the courts in environmental policy making. # Of Toxic Wastes and Government Failure (PDF) This lecture examines how mass politics extended the environmental mandate, bringing about stringent regulations and standards for hazardous waste control. What mobilizes public participation in environmental policy and how does that participation affect policy? How does the public grapple with complex scientific and technical issues? How do government and media organizations respond to public pressures? # The Reagan Revolution: Rethinking Environmental Policy (PDF) The Reagan administration comes to power critical of "big government" in general and government regulation in particular--especially environmental regulation. Arguing that environmental regulation was hobbling the economy the administration tried to dismantle the environmental framework that had been established the previous decade. One of its more lasting efforts was to require cost-benefit analysis for environmental regulations. # Regulatory Reform and Economic Tools (PDF) General dissatisfaction with big government and the seeming stagnation of environmental policy opens the door for advocates of economic mechanisms to guide environmental policy choices. Markets, taxes, subsidies, etc. can be employed to elicit voluntary environmentalism. # Environmental Equity and Justice (PDF) There can be no doubt that 30 years of environmental policy has lessened the pollution burden on the nation, slowed the loss of ecological communities and species, and improved our quality of life. But not all Americans have benefited equally. Some Americans--minorities and the poor, in particular--may have enjoyed no benefit at all. Is this "unfair" distribution of environmental benefits just an artifact of policy or does it reflect racial and class biases in our society? # Environmental Protection and Wise Use of Public Lands (PDF) This lecture explores the rise of anti-environmentalism in the western revolt against federal control of public lands and its spill over to environmental policy in the rest of the country. It investigates relationships among the Presidency, Congress, federal agencies, and interest groups and how those relationships determine public lands policy. Focus on the collision between public and private interests and values. # Risk Assessment and the Public's Right to Know (PDF) Risk assessment is an important tool in environmental policymaking. We examine its use in providing safe drinking water. We look at how public information and collaborative/voluntary approaches can reduce environmental risks and improve environmental quality. # Property Rights and Suburban Sprawl (PDF) This class focuses on suburban "sprawl" and its impacts on landscape: development, habitat fragmentation, etc. # Community-Based Environmental Protection To this point our discussions have looked at environmental policy as conceived and implemented by national and state governments. Some argue that the "next wave" of progress in environmental policy will be place-based local environmentalism. # Comparing Environment Policymaking Around the World (PDF) For the past few months we have looked at how institutions, interest groups, elected officials, etc. define and shape solutions to US environmental problems. In this lecture we look briefly at other countries and their experience with acid rain. We consider whether different political institutions result in different outcomes, or if cultural, economic, or demographic factors are more important for explaining differences among national environmental policies. # Energy and the Environment (PDF) Cheap energy drives the American economy; indeed, it drives the global economy. But cheap energy carries a heavy environmental price tag. Extracting fossil fuels despoils the landscape. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. Hydropower devastates river ecology, while nuclear power leaves deadly wastes behind. How do we decide these tradeoffs? # Big Solutions for Big Problems: Deep Ecology and Bioregionalism Some believe that the Earth cannot be saved untill humans recognize that they are a minor player in the natural world. Putting the Earth first--well ahead of human greed and desire--is the path of deep ecology. Can chaining yourself naked to trees or blowing up shopping malls save the earth? #   # Climate Change and Other Global Environmental Issues (PDF) Bio-homogenization, alien species, climate change # Climate Change and Other Global Environmental Issues</calendar>

 <tag> Sloan School of Management </tag>
 <keywords>,Globalization,Management,Operations Management,Organizational Behavior</keywords>
 <calendar> Going "Global" and Being "Global": To be global or not to be global—is that one question? Learning Objectives Understand how globalization and its changing wave impact product markets, business models, companies and management—and why such impact has been mounting and changing over time. Unscramble "global" and decode expressions such as "international," "multinational," "transnational," etc. Identify levels of analysis in geography (world / region / country / site) and in business (industry / company / local unit). Delineate the concepts and specificities of "global strategy" and the relevance of time with the separate consideration of "internationalization strategy." # The Advantage of Internationalization: Why go "against a sea of troubles"? Learning Objectives Analyze how internationalization enables companies to increase their value propositions and understand the nature of such benefits. Learn how to evaluate potential internationalization strategies. Anticipate the organizational and individual challenges of internationalization. # Exploiting Home-Based Advantage: Is it easier when you have a paragon at home? Learning Objectives Analyze how internationalization enables companies to exploit home-based advantage and appreciate the nature of such advantage. Identify when a country or a cluster is the optimal place in the world for a given business or industry. Design an internationalization strategy based on home-based advantage. # Augmenting Home-Based Advantage: When do foreign CATs improve home RATs? Learning Objectives Analyze how internationalization enables firms to enhance their home-based advantage. Understand the resource-based view to explain internationalization. Apply Lessard's "RATs test" and "CATs test" to identify and evaluate internationalization strategies. Analyze the desirability and difficulty of building and exploiting a "virtual diamond". # Building Metanational Advantage: To be national or not to be national—is that the question? Learning Objectives Understand how companies can build global advantage by melding knowledge that is dispersed around the world. Appreciate the different nature of metanational advantage relative to straight or augmented home-base advantage—especially in the case of "global startups". Learn the organizational capabilities to build metanational advantage and the significant challenges posed by such endeavor. # Between a Global Business and a Global Company: Exporter or multinational—is that an option? Learning Objectives Recognize how globalization and information and communication technologies have opened up the possibilities for global business so that even a local company must contemplate a global strategy. Analyze different global business models (such as pure exporter, global business network, international alliance, or multinational company). Consider the specific challenges of "going global" from an emergent market—and the specific challenges for developed market multinationals to compete with emerging market multinationals. # Global Integration and National Responsiveness: Global and local—is that an imperative? Learning Objectives Learn about the "Integration/Responsiveness" framework and the infamous "Think Global, Act Local." Distinguish between "integration" and "aggregation." Understand how global integration impacts performance. Understand how local rootedness and local adaptation impact performance. Realize the managerial and organizational challenges posed by global integration and by national responsiveness. # Local Adaptation: Can you weld uniformity in different places? Learning Objectives Realize how the local environment shapes business and organizational choices. Appreciate the complexity of local adaptation and how it is not just about products, prices or business models but also about organization. Learn about traditional "localization" and how it has changed with globalization. Understand the roles of local managers and of expatriates in local adaptation. # Global Strategy and Knowledge Management: How do you spread it all over the world? Learning Objectives Understand the growth and challenges of sharing "best-practices" and of "global knowledge management" in multinational companies. Learn about contemporary strategies and tools for knowledge management in multinational companies while realizing the pros and cons of technology-mediated communication. Analyze the relationship between knowledge management and global strategy. # Global Delivery: Why bother? Learning Objectives Appreciate why there are relatively few multinationals in services. Realize the peculiarities of global strategy and organization for services or solution providers (in particular, the differences between "global supply chains" and "global delivery chains"). Understand the emergence and impact of "global customers". Consider the specific challenges and implications of "going global" from an emergent market as a solutions provider. # Global Innovation: Local Innovation—seriously? Learning Objectives Understand why R&amp;D and innovation has been mostly a local process, namely at home, even in the largest globally dispersed companies—and why this is changing rapidly in several businesses. Recognize the "supply-side" and the "demand-side" of innovations and the differentiated roles of country units in innovation processes in a multinational company. Analyze the particular value and costs of "global innovation" for incremental innovations and for breakthrough innovations. Understand the strategic value of innovations for the "bottom-of-the-pyramid". </calendar>

 <calendar> Introductions: instructors and students identify personal, intellectual, and professional interests and introduce themselves: a) In relation to the course title and description. b) By formulating questions in response to the Paper Tiger Video, "Donna Haraway Reads National Geographic on Primates." (1989) First look at "KAQ" (Knowledge claims-Actions that follow Questions for Inquiry) framework for teasing out diverse inquiries, in this case inquiries based on students' initial responses to the video. # Probing each other's KAQs on the Haraway case Discussion of questions raised about requirements, the wiki, and the syllabus. Check-in (= succinct reports) on findings from inquiry between classes. Introduction to the "Actions that follow" part of KAQ. Workshop on generating questions, inquiring into them, and designing the resource guide required by case 1 # Case 1, continued. Presentation of guides for teaching/engaging others to interpret the cultural dimensions of science. # Case 2: The Werskey case Probing each other's KAQs and in-class research with coaching by the instructors. # Case 2, continued.

 <calendar>Introduction Questions of the day: What is urban design? What is urban development? How are they connected and how do they affect our lives? # Ways of Seeing the City Questions of the day: What are the visible signs of change in cities? How can we measure the form of cities? How do the underlying values of the observer influence what is observed? # The Forces That Made Boston Questions of the day: What does the history of Boston's development tell us about the issues facing the city today? Are these forces common to all cities? # Walking Tour of Boston Meet at the Government Center T-Stop (outside in front of the City Hall) at 8:00 am. For those students who can't join the tour until 10:30 - we will be in the Skywalk of the Prudential Center Tower (800 Boylston Street between Exeter and Gloucester Streets) at approximately 10:30 am. We will end the tour at noon at South Station Quincy Market where you can have lunch and/or catch a train back to MIT. # The Design of American Cities Questions of the day: What can you tell about a city's origins from its founders? What is the difference between agrarian settlements and industrial cities? What happened to cities as America industrialized? # The Industrial City and Its Critics Questions of the day: What were nineteenth century and early twentieth century housing and workplace reformers trying to reform? Do we still have company towns? # Development Controls Part I: The Institutionalization of Planning and Zoning Questions of the day: Can we design cities without designing buildings? How can zoning and other design controls improve our public space? # Development Controls Part II: Beyond Zoning: Urban Design Guidelines, Design Review and Development Incentives Questions of the day: What is the relationship between development incentives and quality public space? Can urban design guidelines and design review ensure good urban design? What are the newest development controls used by planners? # Three Urban Utopias: - Ebenezer Howard's Garden City - Le Corbusier's Radiant City - Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City Questions of the day: What assumptions does each thinker make about how people should live in cities? What beliefs does each hold about the relationship between city design and social change? What aspects of these "utopias" have actually come to pass? # New Towns in the United States and Abroad Question of the day: What motivates planners to design new towns? # The Suburbs Part I: The Origins and Growth of Suburbs Questions of the day: Why do we have suburbs? How and why do the designs of new suburbs differ from the designs of older ones? # The Suburbs Part II: Rethinking American Suburbs Questions of the day: How do "urbanism" and "suburbanism" differ as "ways of life"? What is the appeal of small town life, and can this be designed? # Shaping Private Development/Growth Management Questions of the day: What are the social consequences of sprawl? Can private development be controlled to manage growth on the regional scale? What are the current techniques used to manage growth?

 <calendar> Introduction to the Course Why bother taking this class? # Fish Banks Simulation We begin with an in-class simulation illustrating the public problems that can arise through private actions in the market place. # Fish Banks Simulation (cont.) # What are "Public Policies?" What is this thing we call "public policy" and why does it exist? Is there more to the "public interest" than the aggregation of self-interests or finding solutions to common problems? What is a public problem? What did we experience in the Fish Banks simulation? What could have been done to improve the outcome? # Designing Government? Governments come in infinite varieties. If we could design a government from scratch, what characteristics would we like to see? How should it be organized? What "institutions" would we want to create? The American Model of governance serves as the foundation for this discussion and the rest of the course. We look at the design, distribution of authority, and relationships among legislatures, executive agencies, and the courts in the context of American federalism. # Models of Public Policy Decision Making In thinking about formulating public policy, we begin by approaching the task as an exercise in technical problem solving. What is the problem? What are the most promising solutions? We then expand our thinking to include other -- sometimes powerful -- considerations that influence the choice of solutions. # National Security Policy - Foreign Threats Providing security from external threats is the historical role of government. We examine "who" makes national security policy. # National Security Policy - Domestic Threats Does the "technical approach" really capture all the important elements of good public policy? We examine the basic concepts of security and liberty exploring how they are used to argue, validate, and legitimize policy claims. We introduce the idea of policy tradeoffs. # Trade and Development Policy We move on to the basic concepts of equity, fairness, and efficiency exploring how they are used to argue, validate, and legitimize policy claims. # Trade and Development Policy (cont.) # Environmental Policy: Pollution and Environmental Justice When civil rights and environmental protection clash. # Environmental Policy: Pollution and Environmental Justice (cont.) # Environmental Policy: Endangered Species The history of the endangered species act is a history of collisions among public interests and between public interests and private interests. How did this law come to be? What does it tell us about government intent and law making? # Environmental Policy: Endangered Species (cont.) # Energy Policy Government can provide information (mileage, safety). # Health Policy # Health Policy (cont.) # Health Policy (cont.) # Social Policy # Social Policy: Allocating Rights Government can create rights. Civil rights, property rights, privacy rights are conveyed by the government to its citizens. These rights shape and constrain policy and may be tested as times change. # Social Policy (cont.) # Crime Policy: A Cost-Benefit Analysis Using public resources for the greatest public benefit. # Public Health and Risk Assessment How safe is too safe? What Price Safety? # Evaluating Educational Policy Can market competition improve education? What works?</calendar>

 <calendar> Introduction: Defining the educational problem These readings examine three major dimensions of the economy's performance. One is the growth of productivity, the determinant of rising living standards. The second is income inequality. The third is income mobility—the extent to which someone born in one part of the income distribution moves to another part of the distribution (higher or lower) over their lifetime. As we will see, all three of these dimensions rely to some degree on education. # Human capital theory: The basic economic perspective on education This reading summarizes the basic approach of economists to education in which education is viewed as an investment made by the individual (you deciding to go to college), society (provision of public K-12 schools) or both (you deciding to go to a state university). From an individual's perspective, evaluating the investment is similar to evaluating whether one should invest in an office building or a new printer for an office. # Early childhood education: How important? Society or the individual can invest in education at different points in the individual's life: Early childhood, grades K-6, on-the-job training and so on. Investments at different points in the life cycle may give very different rates of return. These pieces examine the proposition that much of cognitive functioning is well established by the time the child is age four or five with the implication that the rate of return to educational investments in grades K-12 is much lower—i.e. it is not where we should be putting our greatest efforts. Read the Feinstein article for general content and its main conclusions and do not spend a lot of time on those statistical parts that you don't understand. # When did earnings become so dependent on education? If we want to explain market changes over time, a central question is whether the supply side or the demand side of the market is doing most of the changing. Imagine you are examining the behavior of the market for middle-aged men whose education stopped with a bachelors' degree. Do you expect the supply side of this market to change more quickly than the demand side or vice-versa? # Do our regression estimates overestimate the impact of education on earnings? The case of ability bias. Think about a regression model that estimates the impact of an additional year of schooling on earnings. We know that on average, students who graduate high school have higher grades, test scores, etc. than students who drop out. Similarly, students who go to college typically have higher grades, test scores, etc. than students whose education stops with a high school diploma. Question: Why might this "sorting" cause us to question our regression estimate of the effect on earnings of an additional year of education? # If the return to education is real, does it reflect skills learned or is it a signal? If the estimated return to education is accurate, why does it exist? Does, say, the earnings value of a college diploma reflect what is learned in the college? Or, alternatively, do the employers see the diploma as a signal that the student was smart enough to get into college in the first place? Before reading the articles, ask yourself what data you might use to distinguish between these two possibilities. # Why has the rate of return to education increased? We now know from wage data that labor market demand has shifted heavily toward more educated labor. To what extent do these shifts reflect changes in technology? In international trade? In institutional factors like unions and CEO perceptions of "appropriate behavior"? # What skills are now rewarded in the workplace? If the combination of computerization and offshoring is reducing the number of jobs requiring "rules-based" thinking, how do we describe the thinking required for the jobs that are left - particularly those jobs that pay good wages? # Midterm # Do smaller classes raise achievement? Reducing class size is one of the most discussed ways to raise student achievement. Because the reform is simple to explain, it is a good starting point to discuss questions we will face for the rest of the course: Exactly how is this reform supposed to raise student achievement? What kind of evidence do we need to know whether this reform works? Can we get the evidence from "natural experiments" that occur out in the world? Alternatively, do we need to conduct controlled experiments that we evaluate? If so, how should the experiment/evaluation be structured? # School vouchers and parental choice A second frequently discussed educational reform is educational choice including school vouchers. With a few exceptions (which we will discuss in class), natural experiments involving school choice are hard to come by. The question, then, is how we should set up and evaluate demonstration experiments. The issue becomes more complex because many parties to this debate have strong pro or anti-choice views and structure their analyses to support their opinions. One of our jobs is to factor out that bias. There are only two papers for this topic because the second paper is quite detailed. You should be able to understand all the results even if you do not understand all the statistical methodology. # School accountability, standards and testing A third widely used educational reform is a set of educational standards and assessments - think "No Child Left Behind". Unlike traditional standardized tests - for example, the California Achievement Tests or Iowa tests that many of you took in elementary school - the scores of these assessments are widely publicized to the public and their design (which varies from state to state) raises a number of questions: What subjects should be tested? How should the tests be designed (Multiple Choice? Partial credit for how you set up a problem? etc.)? Should good test scores lead to a reward for the school? For the individual teacher? Should bad test scores lead to penalties? # Teacher quality and teacher training Policy makers discuss the need do improve teacher quality but unlike smaller class size or standards, it is not very clear how to do it. There are at least four questions we need to answer. What has actually happened to teacher quality over time? What characteristics should we look for when we hire teachers? What characteristics should we look for in deciding whether to give a teacher tenure? And are there things we can do to improve the classroom skills of teachers who are already on the job? # Can technology complement what teachers do? Everyone agrees that well-educated students must know how to get information from the Web, etc. There is less agreement on whether computer technology can complement teachers in their instructional role. We can think of two broad application areas: Computer tutors that help students work on basic reading, writing and mathematics, and simulations that require students to solve complex "real world" problems in the classroom. Most of our focus in this section will be on drills including a case study of computer-graded essays - how the software was developed and what it can do. # Higher education: Basic issues and structure For most policy makers, one U.S. educational goal is a greater number of college graduates. Here as in earlier topics, we need to clarify why the current number of college graduates is limited. Is it that too few kids are applying? Is it that an adequate number are applying but too many drop out? At the same time, before we can think about policy, we need to understand what colleges are trying to do just as we need to understand what firms are trying to do before we can consider the impact of tax policy. # Higher education policy Turning to policy, expanded financial aid, remedial instruction and services to encourage students to continue in college are three of the most discussed tools for increasing the number of college graduates. The question is how well each of these tools work? # Wrap up</calendar>

 <calendar> Introduction to the Course # The Policy Process and the Political Debate Over "Sound Science" What are the critiques, from the left and the right, of the other side's use of science? What are the implicit models of (1) science and (2) the policy process that underpin both sides' critiques? Given that each side seems to say the same thing about the other, can you come up with an alternative to the rational model of science in environmental policymaking? # The Scientific Method and the Production of Scientific Knowledge What is science? What do scientists do? How do they produce scientific knowledge? In what ways do positivists, relativists (or constructivists), and pragmatic realists answer these questions? Is science a source of reliable and valid knowledge about the world? Why, or why not? # Environmental (Regulatory) Science, Experts, and Expertise What is environmental (regulatory, applied) science? How and why is it different from "pure" (academic, bench) science? How, exactly, is regulatory science "made"? To what extent, and in what ways, do scientists' values, or worldviews, influence the practice of environmental science? How do scientists perceive their role in the policy process? Where do they get their authority? Why do scientific experts disagree in environmental policy disputes? # Environmental Advocacy: Using Science to Define Problems How do advocates use science to define/frame environmental policy issues? Why does advocates' framing of issues matter -- that is, how might it affect policymaking? # Media Coverage of Science and Environmental Risk How do the media cover science and environmental risk? To what extent and how do the media affect environmental policymaking, given their coverage of these topics? # The Public's Perception of Science and Environmental Risk How does the public view science and scientists? How does the public understand environmental risk? How are the public's views shaped, and how might those views affect decision making? # Science in Legislative Decision Making How does Congress deal with science when making legislative decisions? Why do members of Congress treat science the way they do? What kinds of policies does Congress produce, and how do they reflect the scientific understanding of environmental problems? # Science in Administrative and Judicial Decision Making How do agencies treat science in making administrative decisions and why? How do the courts treat scientific expertise and agencies' use of science? How do agency decision makers' expectations of judicial review influence their treatment of science-based decisions? # Science in the International Arena What are some differences in the way science is incorporated into the policy process in other (developing, developed) nations? How does decision making in the international arena reflect these cross-country differences? How is the use of science in international environmental policymaking different from the use of science within countries? # Advocacy Science vs. Collaborative Science To what extent and how should we incorporate the public into science-based decision making? What is "joint fact finding" -- how does it work, and why do proponents think it is preferable to the conventional approach? What are some potential drawbacks creating the scientific basis for decision making collaboratively? # Local Knowledge What, exactly, is "local knowledge" or "traditional ecological knowledge," and why might we want (or not want) to include it in our assessments of how the natural world works? What is "popular epidemiology," and how might it impede or enhance our ability to understand environmental diseases? # Uncertainty, Adaptive Management and the Precautionary Principle What is adaptive management? What is the rationale for adaptive management -- why do scientists believe it will enhance the use of science in environmental policymaking? What is the precautionary principle, and how is it related, if at all, to adaptive management?</calendar>
